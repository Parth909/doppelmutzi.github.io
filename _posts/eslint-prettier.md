title: Establishing ab efficient Code Analyzing and Formatting Workflow (for Vue.js applications) with eslint and prettier
---

Lately, I have been investigating quite some time into linting and formatting of Javascript code for large projects with many developers and a diverse set of editors and IDEs. In many projects at work tools like jshint, eslint, or prettier are all over the place. I realized that I didn't have a thorough overview of concepts and technologies for static code analyzing and formatting. Thus, I started to get a better idea on how to establish a robust workflow that also works for different editors as well as from npm scripts.
