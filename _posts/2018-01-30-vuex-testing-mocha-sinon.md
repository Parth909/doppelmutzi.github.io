## Skeleton for Testing Actions and Websocket Communication

```javascript
// actions.spec.js
import sinon from "sinon";
import sinonChai from "sinon-chai";
import chai from "chai";
import Vue from "vue";

import { testAction } from "./testUtils";
import actions from "@/store/actions";
import * as mutationTypes from "@/store/mutation-types";
import StompPlugin from "@/store/StompPlugin";
import * as stompTypes from "@/store/stomp-message-types";

chai.use(sinonChai);
Vue.use(StompPlugin);

describe("actions", () => {
  beforeEach(function() {
    mock.reset();
  });
  describe("user actions", () => {
    /* tests here */
  });
});
```

## How to Test Vuex Actions?

Before I answer this question, let's have a quick recap of a _Vuex_ action.

```javascript
export const loadUsers = function({ commit }) {
  axios
    .get(`/api/allusers`)
    .then(response => {
      commit(mutationTypes.SET_USERS, response.data);
    })
    .catch(e => {
      commit(mutationTypes.FAILURE, "500");
    });
};
```

Besides the fact, that virtually every time a remote call is performed (we deal with this fact later), an action will commit one or more mutations based on the context. The context is created, e.g., by the response of the remote call or the action's arguments like state or a payload.

The main purpose of actions is to commit mutations. Thus, we want to verify that _Vuex's commit_ function is invoked correctly with the correct arguments. Since we do not want to invoke the implementation, we want to mock the _commit_ function. In the following section we deal with this aspect.

## Mocking Vuex's Commit Object

Based on the [official Vuex documentation](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/testing.html) for testing actions, I created a file named _testUtils.js_ as testing helper. We utilize the _testAction_ function in our tests in order to verify that the action under test invokes the correct mutations with the correct arguments.

Before I go into the implementation details of our helper function, I show you how we want to use it later in tests. The following snippet constitutes a test outlining the testing approach we strive for as depicted in the last section.

```javascript
it("should invoke correct mutations for successful GET", done => {
  const response = {
    foodlist: ["salmon", "peanut butter"]
  };
  mock.onGet("/api/getnextbreakfast").reply(200, response);
  const actionPayload = null;
  const state = null;
  const expectedMutations = [
    {
      type: mutationTypes.SET_NEXT_BREAKFAST,
      payload: response
    },
    {
      type: mutationTypes.CHANGE_AVAILABLE_FOODS,
      payload: response.foodlist
    }
  ];
  testAction(loadNextBreakfast, actionPayload, state, expectedMutations, done);
});
```

The exemplary test above verifies that the _Vuex_ action _loadNextBreakfast_ commits the expected mutations, described with the array _expectedMutations_. _type_ and _payload_ represent the arguments of [Vuex's commit function](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/dev/src/store.js). We want to verify inside our helper function that the correct mutations were triggered with the correct arguments. _payload_ can be null, if a mutation needs to be committed only with a type. _actionPayload_ and _state_ are optional arguments and, thus, can be null. If the action under test needs to operate on the state and / or requires an payload object as input, you have to provide it with these two arguments.

The implementation of _testAction_ contains the logic to mock the _commit_ function. It is displayed in the next code snippet.

```javascript
// testUtils.js
import { expect } from "chai";

export const testAction = (
  action,
  actionPayload,
  state,
  expectedMutations,
  done
) => {
  let count = 0;
  let commit = (type, payload) => {
    let mutation = expectedMutations[count];
    try {
      // check if commit function is invoked with expected args
      expect(mutation.type).to.equal(type);
      if (payload) {
        expect(mutation.payload).to.deep.equal(payload);
      }
      count++;
      // check if all mutations have been dispatched
      if (count >= expectedMutations.length) {
        done();
      }
    } catch (error) {
      done(error);
    }
  };

  // check if no mutations should have been dispatched
  if (expectedMutations.length === 0) {
    expect(count).to.equal(0);
    done();
  } else {
    // call the action with mocked store and arguments
    action({ commit, state }, actionPayload);
  }
};
```

In the beginning, I had a hard time to understand the _Vuex_ documentation and I think it might help to break the code into pieces and explain it step by step.

Let's start with the function arguments.

```javascript
export const testAction = (
  action,
  actionPayload,
  state,
  expectedMutations,
  done
) => {
  // ...
};
```

* **action** refers to the function name of the action that needs to be called in the context of the test
* **actionPayload** constitutes the payload that is passed as argument to the action under test. We pass _null_ if the action does not accept a payload.
* **state** represents the _Vuex state object_ that is required by the action under test. The object only needs to define the properties needed by the action. It can also be _null_ if the action does not operate on the state.
* **expectedMutations** is an array that hold one or more objects that hold the arguments for the invocation of the _commit_ function. The following shows an example

```Javascript
const expectedMutations = [
  {
    type: mutationTypes.TOGGLE_SHOW_DONE_TASKS
  },
  {
    type: mutationTypes.ADD_ITEM,
    payload: {
      done: true,
      description: "dummy"
    }
  }
];
```

* **done** is a callback that we need to invoke inside our helper function when the test is complete. This is because _Vuex_ actions are asynchronous. You can read more about this concept in the [Mocha documentation on how to test asynchronous code](https://mochajs.org/#asynchronous-code).

Next up, the function body.

## Implementing Action Tests

### Testing Use Case 1: Checking of Correct Commit Invocation

To get our feet wet, let's start with a simple example. Consider the following action _toggleShowDoneTasks_ inside _actions.js_.

```Javascript
// actions.js
import Vue from "vue";
import * as mutationTypes from "./mutation-types";

export default {
  toggleShowDoneTasks({ commit }) {
    commit(mutationTypes.TOGGLE_SHOW_DONE_TASKS);
  }
};
```

For the sake of clarity, we skip the actual mutations and, instead, consider them as black boxes. We just want to test actions, i.e., we want to verify whether mutations are invoked correctly with the correct arguments. In the above action, we just invoke _commit_ with a mutation type without any payload.

Let's take a look at the test for this action. We leverage our _testAction_ function from above.

```Javascript
// actions.spec.js
it("toggleShowDoneTasks should invoke correct mutation", done => {
    const payload = null;
    const state = null;
    const expectedMutations = [
      {
        type: mutationTypes.TOGGLE_SHOW_DONE_TASKS
      }
    ];
    testAction(
      actions.toggleShowDoneTasks,
      payload,
      state,
      expectedMutations,
      done
    );
  });
```
