As a developer I'm convinced that using a mouse or trackpad is a major distraction and flow-breaker. 
I strive for using keyboard shortcuts as much as possible to be more productive while programming. 

Out of the box, Mac OS X does not provide many keyboard shortcuts when it comes to window management. As an example, Mac OS does not allow to throw a focused window to another space.

In this article I want to present my curated list of useful Mac tools to manage windows, displays, and spaces (of [Mission Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Control_(macOS))) without mouse. I hope you retire your mouse after reading this post.

# Spectacle &ndash; The missing Window Manager

[Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) is an awesome tool that allows for changing the size or position of a particular window. It upgrades Mac OS 
in a way that you can use keyboard shortcuts to resize or move focused windows of any app. Sophisticated window management by shortcuts is one aspect I have missed from Microsoft Windows when I was working in a project with PCs as development machines.  In my current project 
I have an environment with two external displays in addition to the built-in display of my Macbook. Spectacle provides 
customizable shortcuts even for throwing a focused window to another display. 

I appreciate Spectacle's simplicity. You have a nice glasses icon in the menu bar to see all window actions along with keyboard shortcuts at a glance. To change them just go to the setting dialog.

The following recording gives an impression how Spectacle works. I used the shortcuts as you can see in the screenshot above.
