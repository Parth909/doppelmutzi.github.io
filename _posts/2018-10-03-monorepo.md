This post is my take on the topic of _Mono-Repo_. After a brief introduction to _Mono-Repo_ and a comparison with _Multi-Repo_, I go into tools to establishing _Mono-Repos_.

I don't want to assess in great detail what repo typ is better in which circumenstance. However, the goal of this article is all about _Mono-Repos_ and how [lerna](https://lernajs.io/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) ([workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/workspaces)) can help. It also makes sense to use these tools in combination. Especially _lerna_ and _yarn workspaces_ can peacefully coexist in a project. How, we will find out in a minute.

# What is a Mono-Repo? How does it Compare to Multi-Repo?

Tools like _lerna_ and _yarn workspaces_ have been a decisive factor with the result that managing your codebase in a single repo (a.k.a. _Mono-Repo_) has gained some traction for about one or two years. A lot of articles were written or conference talks were given about this topic. I don't want to go to deeply into the theory behind _Mono-Repos_, however, I would like to describe briefly what they are and how they compare to _Multi-repos_ in a way that we have a similar understanding.

**TODO** Mono-repo vs Multi-repo...

# Tool Landscape for Mono-Repos

A _Mono-Repo_ hosts one or more projects or packages. Those packages are &quot;Mini-Repos&quot; that can be versioned, built, and published independently. Therefore, every package contains its own _package.json_ file due to the fact that every package is a full-fledged project on its own.
Packages might have dependency relations between each other. Managing these dependencies are implemented by symlinks.

As we see later, _lerna_ and _yarn workspaces_ give us the ability to build libraries and apps in a single repo without forcing us to publish to npm or other registries. The beauty behind these technologies is that they can find package dependencies by analyzing the _package.json_ files located at each package root folder. Thereby, these tools make it obsolete to manually create symlinks or use &quot;low-level&quot; _npm link_ directly.

This results in faster code-test-debug cycles by sharing components locally. _lerna_ and _yarn workspaces_ together improve the developer experience of managing multiple packages in a _Mono-Repo_.

## Correlation between _npm_, _yarn_, _yarn workspaces_, and _lerna_

I want to shed some light on the clutter how _npm_, _yarn_, _yarn workspaces_, and _lerna_ are involved in the topic of _Mono-repos_. Take a look at the following &quot;set diagram&quot;.

![Native features](../images/monorepos/native.png)

It depicts three main players and how they correlate. By the way, do not take the proportions too seriously. The diagram's purpose is just to give an impression how things are connected. Furthermore, I do not go into great detail because this would go beyond the purpose of this article. If you are interested on more details on this topic, consider my article about **TODO npm vs yarn**.

_npm_ (marked by 1) and _yarn_ (2) are both native package managers that have many features in common (3). As an example, both leverage the concept of _package.json_ as container for dependency management, which was introduced by _npm_ back in the days. More shared concepts and features are dependency management, publishing, or using lock files to &quot;freeze&quot; dependency versions. There are even more features originated by _npm_ that are also leveraged by _yarn_, such as publishing to npm registry.

One of the reasons for creating _yarn_ in the first place was performance &ndash; it took too long to install dependencies in large projects. Another aspect was missing features, such as a sophisticated concept for freezing versions, offline capabilities, or deterministic behavior in terms of dependency resolution. Though, many of these gaps of _npm_ have vanished over the time and both technologies are more and more feature compliant nowadays.

Things that still belong solely to _npm_ (1) or _yarn_ (2) are _package-lock.json_ files or _yarn.lock_ files, respectively. However, for us, the application developers, the different implementation of lock files does not really matter. Practically, _npm_ and _yarn_ are even on how version management is handled.

One big feature that is exclusive to _yarn_ is _yarn workspaces_ (4) that was added to _yarn_ about a year ago. It expands _yarn_ by native mono-repo capabilities. The next section goes more into mono-repo features.

**TODO Beispiele für 1**
**TODO** überlegen, die Grafik abzuändern, so dass (2) viel kleiner ist im Vergleich zu (1) und (3) viel größer dargestellt wird.

## Mono-Repo &ndash; What is native? What is user land?

Consider the next diagram depicting how technologies in the Mono-Repo environment are connected to each other.

![Mono-repo features](../images/monorepos/mono-repo.png)

Marked in read are technologies that provide Mono-Repo capabilities. All of them are based either on _npm_ or _yarn_. Latter do not provide advanced features for building Mono-Repose besides _npm link_ or _yarn link_, respectively.

[yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) is the only representative that exposes Mono-Repo capabilities natively. [lerna](https://lernajs.io) is around for quite some time and even before _yarn workspaces_ has existed. _lerna_ provide Mono-Repo features on the level of user land with _npm_ or _yarn_ as dependency management tool. It leverages semantic links for this purpose. _lerna_ also allows for using _yarn workspaces_ and, then, leaves the whole Mono-Repo aspect solely to the natively implemented features of _yarn workspaces_. Furthermore, _lerna_ provides sophisticated publishing and version management features to even publish projects independently from each other. Short, _lerna_ offers many features beyond Mono-Repo management. On the other side, _yarn workspaces_ sole purpose is to ease the Mono-Repo workflow. So, you do not have to decide for ether side of them. It does totally make sense to use _lerna_ with _yarn workspaces_.

[bolt](https://github.com/boltpkg/bolt) is a relatively new project that bases on _yarn workspaces_. Inspired by _lerna_, its goal is to add more helpful commands on this foundation.

# Different Variants of Configuring _Mono-Repos_

This section's goal is to give a quick overview on how to set up the different tools in different variations. You can understand the screenshots as a kind of &quot;cheat sheets&quot;. The focus is on the configuration part of the different approaches and how they differ.

I created a small repository to demonstrate the different variants. Just [clone the demo project repo](https://github.com/doppelmutzi/monorepo-playground) and switch branches for the different variants. The _README.md_ file describes how to bootstrap and use (i.e., build and run the dummy app) the particular variant. Another goal of this section and demo project is to provide an easy playground to see the different variants in action from different perspectives: which configuration steps are required, what steps are needed to build and use the sub projects (i.e., packages), how does dependency management work, or what are the timing implications for bootstrapping.

## 1. do it yourself

I skip this section but feel free to checkout branch _1-do-it-yourself_. Basically you work with _npm link_ and have to create semantic links and install all sub projects manually. I hope you can imagine how tedious and impractical this scenario is for real-world projects.

## 2. lerna with npm

To get support for automating such manual tasks of approach 1, _lerna_ was introduced. You need a _lerna.json_ file in the root folder. As a convention, _lerna_ uses _npm_ as default.

As you see in the next screenshot, you basically need to edit two files for getting _lerna_ up and running: _lerna.json_ and _package.json_. Within _lerna.json_ you need to specify where _lerna_ has to look for packages.

To bootstrap all sub projects, you need to execute _lerna bootstrap_ by invoking the following npm script:

```bash
$ npm run bootstrap
```

What this command basically do is to go into all package's root folders and execute _npm install_. Take a look at the three packages and you will see that _lerna_ caused npm to create a _node_modules_ folder for every package.

![Setup lerna with npm](../images/monorepos/setup-lerna-npm.jpg)

## 3. lerna with yarn

This is the same setup as approach 2. The only difference is that you have to specify _yarn_ as client with the &quot;npmClient&quot; property in _lerna.json_ file.  Bootstrapping is also performed by _lerna_.

What is the difference regarding approach 1? Virtually nothing. Mainly it is a matter of taste because the only difference is whether _lerna_ utilizes _npm_ or _yarn_ as dependency manager. The answer to the question, which one to chose boils down to the following questions:
* which syntax do I prefer? _npm run &lt;command&gt;_ vs _yarn &lt;command&gt;
* Should I stick to the quasi-standard or do I like the effort of Facebook
* Do I really care about bootstrapping time? If so, take a look at the next chapter which provides some performance benchmarks.

![Setup lerna with yarn](../images/monorepos/setup-lerna-yarn.jpg).

## 4. yarn workspaces
For this approach, you do not need _lerna_. _yarn workspaces_ come with built-in _Mono-Repo_ capabilities. To use _yarn workspaces_ you need _yarn_ version 1.0 or higher. As you can see in the following screenshot, you do not need a dedicated configuration file. The _package.json_ file in the root folder needs to be private and has to have a _workspaces_ property that tells _yarn_ where to find the sub projects.

To bootstrap the project with all its packages, you just use _yarn_ since _yarn workspaces_ provides this feature natively:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

or short:

```bash
$ yarn
```

This combines both steps of approach 1 and 2: Installing the dependencies of the root folder and bootstrapping of all packages' dependencies.

![Setup yarn workspaces](../images/monorepos/setup-yarn-workspaces.jpg)

One big difference in comparison to approach 1 and 2 is that _yarn workspaces_ creates only one _node_modules_ folder. All dependencies are hoisted to the root folder.

## 5. lerna with yarn workspaces

To configure _yarn workspaces_ you have to have the same configuration in the root's _package.json_ as described in approach 4. However, you need to provide a _lerna.json_ file in the root folder, too. There, you need to tell _lerna_ to use _yarn workspaces_. Unfortunately, you have to specify the location of the sub projects redundantly in _lerna.json_. To bootstrap the project no _lerna bootstrap_ is required, you just have to use _yarn install_ as described in approach 4.

![Setup lerna with yarn workspaces](../images/monorepos/setup-lerna-yarn-workspaces.jpg)

So with this setup, _lerna_ completely dedicates the dependency and bootstrapping workflow to _yarn workspaces_. So, you need to configure more to achieve the same as the previous approach. Why should you then use this way over approach 4? Well, think about this &ndash; using _lerna_ and _yarn workspaces_ at the same time make totally sense. They coexist peacefully together in a _Mono-Repo_ project.

In such a scenario:
* You solely use _yarn workspaces_ for the _Mono-Repo_ workflow.
* You use _lerna_'s high-level commands to optimize managing of multiple packages, e.g., for testing.
* You use _lerna_ for publishing packages since _lerna_ provides sophisticated features with its _publish_ commmand.


# Lerna and Yarn Workspaces

The last section gives a quick understanding on how to setup _Mono-Repos_ with different configurations. This section's focus is more on the features of _lerna_ and _yarn workspaces_.

# Timing Comparison

One of the main reasons why folks stick to _yarn_ instead of _npm_ is performance in terms of time for installing dependencies. Originally, _yarn_ was developed due to the fact that _npm_ took way too long for installing dependencies (besides the fact that _npm_ had lacked some important features). Meanwhile, _npm_ is available in version 6 and has put a lot of effort to eliminate this gap.

** TODO Anmerkung und Link auf anderen Blog-Artikel, der genauer auf npm vs yarn eingeht

** TODO Verlinken von performance Messungen von npm vs yarn **

Because you can achieve a _Mono-Repo_ in a variety of ways, lets take a look how these different approaches perform. In the remainder of this section, I present the results of my performance experiment. I cloned [the Babel project](https://github.com/babel/babel) because it represents a real-life _Mono-Repo_ with many packages (142 to be precise). Interestingly, the original setup of _Babel_ utilizes _lerna_ with a config that specifies _yarn_ as _npmClient_ (no _yarn workspaces_) and deactivates _yarn_'s lock file generation.

For every approach (2 &ndash; 5) I did the following:

* I changed the configuration required for the corresponding approach (i.e., adapt _package.json_ and _lerna.json_ if required).
* I measured the collapsed time for installation of dependencies and for a dedicated bootstrapping step (if required).
* I measured the time for 3 different use cases. For every use case I performed time measurement 3 times.

The aforementioned use cases (UC) are:

1) Empty npm or yarn cache, removed all _node_modules_ folders, removed all _package-lock.json_ or _yarn.lock_ files.

For a clean cache I executed one of the following command depending on the used npm client:

```bash
$ npm cache clean --force
```

or

```bash
$ yarn cache clean
```

As a helper for removing lock files and _node_modules_ folders, I added a script to Babel's root folder called _cleanup.sh_:

```bash
find . -type f -name 'yarn.lock' -exec rm {} +
find . -type f -name 'package-lock.json' -exec rm {} +
find . -name "node_modules" -type d -prune -exec rm -rf '{}' +
```

Depending on the use case, I eventually comment out the first 2 lines.

For measuring the execution time of the steps for installing and bootstrapping dependencies, I utilized [gnomon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gnomon).

The following shows an example for approach 2 (_lerna_ with _npm_) and UC 1 (empty cache, no _node_modules_ folders, no lock files as precondition):how I measured the time
```bash
$ npm cache clean --force && ./cleanup.sh && npm i | gnomon && npm run bootstrap | gnomon
```

The following animated gif demonstrates how this looks like.

** TODO animated gif **

To switch _node_ and _npm_ versions, I utilize [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). The following example first installs and uses _v9_ of _node_ and then installs _v5.7.1_ of _npm_.
```bash
$ nvm install v9
$ nvm use v9
$ npm i -g npm@5.7.1
```

## Aproach 6 (lerna + npm ci + Audit) &ndash; Node v10.12.0 / npm v6.4.1 / lerna 3.4.3

In this approach I use _lerna_ with [npm ci](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/171556855892/introducing-npm-ci-for-faster-more-reliable) that constitutes an alternative for _npm install_ in a continuous integration context. Starting with version 3 of _lerna_, _npm ci_ is the default for the installation command. However, you can opt-out.

For this approach, _package-lock.json_ files have to exist. _node_modules_ folders should have been deleted, otherwise you get warnings printed out to the terminal. Thus, UC 3 is not possible.

## Aproach 6 (lerna + npm ci) &ndash; Node v9 / npm v5.7.1 / lerna 3.4.3

I wanted to test this setup because with this _npm_ version the _npm ci_ command is available but without the [auditing feature](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/173719309445/npm-audit-identify-and-fix-insecure).
