This post is my take on the topic of _Mono-Repo_. After a brief introduction to _Mono-Repo_ and a comparison with _Multi-Repo_, I go into tools to establishing _Mono-Repos_.

I don't want to assess in great detail what repo typ is better in which circumenstance. However, the goal of this article is all about _Monorepos_ and how [lerna](https://lernajs.io/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) ([workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/workspaces)) can help. It also makes sense to use these tools in combination.
